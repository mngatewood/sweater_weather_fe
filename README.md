# Sweater Weather - Front End

This application uses a back-end API built using Ruby on Rails. You can visit the repository for that project [here](https://github.com/mngatewood/sweater_weather).  The production API is [here](https://mngatewood-weather-be.herokuapp.com/)

## Description/Purpose

This front-end application was built to interact with an API I made in Ruby on Rails. The application serves up weather data based on user input and currently allows the user to save favorite locations without authentication (for demonstration purposes). A future feature will provide authentication that allows users to register, login, and manage their own favorites.

The production site can be viewed [here](https://mngatewood.github.io/sweater_weather_fe/)
